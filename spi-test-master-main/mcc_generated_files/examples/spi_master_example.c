\brief This file contains sample source codes to demonstrate the SPI Foundation Services APIs.

For this example application to work the following needs to be done:
1. Configure the SPI module as follows:
    - Enable SPI: ticked
    - Modes: Master
    - Interrupt driven: unticked
    - Configure other settings as desired.
    - Select TX and RX pins in Pin Manager: Grid View.
2. Make loop back connection to MISO and MOSI or connect SPI pins to a slave
3. If connected to a slave, assign CS pin and add the necessary calls in drive_slave_select_low() and drive_slave_select_high()
4. Program the slave device to exchange the string "data"
5. Call SPI_Master_test() from main()   

This example works like this:
1. Upon reset, the application will transmit a string "data" and read the same number of bytes back.
2. The program will then compare the received string with "data". Returns 1 to indicate a match or 0 if not.
